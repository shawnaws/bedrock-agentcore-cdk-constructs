# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a library of reusable AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) constructs that can be imported and used by other developers in their infrastructure projects. The constructs will provide pre-configured, best-practice implementations of common AWS infrastructure patterns, reducing development time and ensuring consistency across projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to import pre-built CDK constructs into my project, so that I can quickly deploy common infrastructure patterns without writing boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer installs the construct library THEN the system SHALL provide access to all available constructs through standard npm/yarn package management
2. WHEN a developer imports a construct THEN the system SHALL expose a clean, well-documented API for configuration
3. WHEN a developer uses a construct THEN the system SHALL generate valid CloudFormation templates that follow AWS best practices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want constructs to be configurable with sensible defaults, so that I can customize them for my specific use case while maintaining good practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a construct is instantiated without custom configuration THEN the system SHALL apply secure, production-ready default settings
2. WHEN a developer provides custom configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
3. WHEN configuration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize security and best practices over convenience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples for each construct, so that I can understand how to use them effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views the construct documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear usage examples with code snippets
2. WHEN a developer needs to understand construct properties THEN the system SHALL provide complete API documentation with parameter descriptions
3. WHEN a developer encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guides and common patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want constructs to follow TypeScript best practices, so that I get proper type safety and IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer uses the constructs in TypeScript THEN the system SHALL provide full type definitions and IntelliSense support
2. WHEN a developer makes configuration errors THEN the system SHALL catch them at compile time through type checking
3. WHEN a construct is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide clear migration paths

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want constructs to be thoroughly tested, so that I can trust them in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN constructs are released THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests covering all configuration options
2. WHEN constructs generate CloudFormation THEN the system SHALL validate the output through integration tests
3. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN the system SHALL be detected by the test suite before release

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want a clear project structure and build process, so that I can easily add new constructs and maintain existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new construct THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent directory structure and naming convention
2. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript, run tests, and generate documentation automatically
3. WHEN publishing updates THEN the system SHALL follow semantic versioning and generate appropriate release notes
