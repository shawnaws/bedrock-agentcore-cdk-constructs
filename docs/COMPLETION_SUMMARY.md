## Usage

The library is ready for immediate use. Install and import the constructs:

```typescript
import { BedrockKnowledgeBase, BedrockAgentCoreRuntimeAgent } from '@your-org/bedrock-cdk-constructs';

// Create a knowledge base
const kb = new BedrockKnowledgeBase(this, 'MyKB', {
  knowledgeBaseName: 'my-kb',
  // ... configuration
});

// Create an agent
const agent = new BedrockAgentCoreRuntimeAgent(this, 'MyAgent', {
  agentName: 'my-agent',
  knowledgeBaseIds: [kb.knowledgeBaseId],
  // ... configuration
});
```
